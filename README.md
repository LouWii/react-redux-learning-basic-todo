# Learning React + Redux - Creation of a basic todo app

Learning Redux by coding a basic todo app. I know Redux isn't really useful for such use-case, but it's nice to learn it first on a small project.

It's just a standard todo app. It persists data on LocalStorage (yay! what a revolution). You can add todos, check them if they're done, clean the list of checked off todos. Yes, basic stuff.
